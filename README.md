## Features
1. **Modern GUI Design**
   - Developed with PyQt5 for an interactive and responsive user interface.
   - Dynamic components like sliders, buttons, and labels for intuitive interaction.

2. **Camera and QR Code Integration**
   - Real-time video feed from a webcam using OpenCV.
   - Dynamic QR code scanning to extract and display data on the GUI.

3. **Motion and Gripper Control**
   - Full control over the robotâ€™s movement and gripper using buttons and keyboard inputs.
   - Joystick support for enhanced user experience.

4. **Wireless Communication**
   - Communicates with the robot via WiFi, ensuring smooth and reliable data transfer.
   - Sends and receives coordinates and commands in real-time.

5. **Joystick Integration**
   - Supports PS4 joystick input for controlling the robot.
   - Configurable button mapping through JSON configuration.

6. **Adjustable Speed Control**
   - Slider to dynamically adjust the robot's movement speed.
